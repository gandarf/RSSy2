== 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design and technical specifications for RSSy, a modern, web-based RSS feed aggregator. The goal of RSSy is to provide a clean, fast, and user-friendly interface for users to subscribe to and read content from their favorite websites.

== 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Simplicity:** Provide a minimalist and intuitive user interface.
*   **Performance:** Ensure fast feed updates and a responsive user experience.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to modern accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).
*   **Extensibility:** Design a system that can be easily extended with new features in the future.

== 3. Target Audience

The primary audience for RSSy is tech-savvy individuals, bloggers, researchers, and anyone who wants to consolidate their reading from multiple sources into a single, manageable dashboard.

== 4. Features

=== 4.1. Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in using their email address and a password.
*   **Add/Remove Feeds:** Users can add new RSS/Atom feeds by providing a URL. They can also remove feeds they no longer wish to follow.
*   **Feed Aggregation:** The system will periodically fetch new articles from all subscribed feeds.
*   **Article Reading View:** A clean, reader-friendly view for articles, stripping away unnecessary clutter.
*   **Mark as Read/Unread:** Users can manually mark articles as read or unread.

=== 4.2. Advanced Features

*   **Categorization/Tagging:** Users can organize their feeds into categories or apply tags for better organization.
*   **Search:** Full-text search across all subscribed articles.
*   **"Read Later" Functionality:** A feature to save articles for later reading.

== 5. Architecture

The application will follow a standard client-server architecture.

*   **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework.
*   **Backend:** A RESTful API service that handles business logic, data storage, and feed fetching.
*   **Database:** A relational database to store user data, feeds, and articles.
*   **Background Worker:** A separate process responsible for fetching and parsing RSS feeds periodically.

== 6. Data Model

The database will consist of the following main tables:

*   `users`: Stores user information (id, email, password_hash).
*   `feeds`: Stores information about each RSS feed (id, url, title, user_id).
*   `articles`: Stores individual articles (id, feed_id, title, url, content, published_at, is_read).
*   `categories`: (Optional) Stores user-defined categories (id, name, user_id).

== 7. UI/UX Design

The UI will be clean, minimalist, and responsive.

*   **Layout:** A three-column layout is proposed.
    1.  **Left Column:** Navigation, showing a list of feeds and categories.
    2.  **Middle Column:** A list of articles from the selected feed/category.
    3.  **Right Column:** The content of the selected article.
*   **Color Palette:** A simple, high-contrast color scheme will be used for readability.

== 8. Technical Stack

|===
| Component | Technology
| Frontend | React (with TypeScript) + Vite
| Backend | Node.js (with Express.js and TypeScript)
| Database | PostgreSQL
| Caching | Redis (for session management and background jobs)
| ORM | Prisma
| UI Library | Material-UI or similar
|===

== 9. Deployment

*   The frontend will be hosted on a static web host like Vercel or Netlify.
*   The backend, database, and worker will be deployed using Docker containers, orchestrated with Docker Compose for simplicity, on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean or AWS.

== 10. Security

*   Passwords will be hashed using a strong algorithm (e.g., Argon2).
*   All communication between the client and server will be over HTTPS.
*   Input will be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
*   Standard security headers will be used.

== 11. Future Considerations

*   **Mobile App:** A native or cross-platform mobile application.
*   **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share articles on social media.
*   **API for third-party clients:** Opening up the backend for other developers to build clients against.
*   **OPML Import/Export:** Allow users to import and export their feed subscriptions.
